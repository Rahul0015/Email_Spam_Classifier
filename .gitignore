### `.gitignore`

This file tells Git which files and folders to ignore when you're committing your code to a repository. This keeps your repository clean by not including temporary files, environment-specific files, or large generated files.

Create a file named `.gitignore` in your `email_classifier/` root directory with the following content:

```gitignore
# Python
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
.Python
env/
venv/
*.egg-info/
.pytest_cache/
.mypy_cache/
.ipynb_checkpoints/

# IDEs
.vscode/ # VS Code specific settings (optional, you might want to share some)
.idea/   # PyCharm specific settings

# OS generated files
.DS_Store # macOS
Thumbs.db # Windows

# Generated files
/models/   # Ignore the entire models directory (since they are generated artifacts)
/data/     # Ignore the data directory (unless you want to commit small datasets)
*.csv      # Ignore all CSV files (if you don't want to commit data)
*.log

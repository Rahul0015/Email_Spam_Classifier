# ðŸ“§ Email Spam Classifier

This project implements an Email Spam Classifier using a Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm. It features a text preprocessing pipeline, TF-IDF for feature extraction, and a user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit.

The goal is to accurately classify incoming emails as either "Ham" (legitimate) or "Spam" (unsolicited/malicious).

## âœ¨ Features

- **Text Preprocessing:** Cleans and normalizes email content (lowercasing, URL/number/punctuation removal, stop word removal, stemming).
- **TF-IDF Feature Extraction:** Converts text data into numerical features that the machine learning model can understand.
- **Multinomial Naive Bayes Model:** A robust and effective algorithm for text classification.
- **Imbalance Handling:** Utilizes `imbalanced-learn` (RandomOverSampler) to address imbalanced datasets, improving classification performance for both Ham and Spam.
- **Streamlit Web App:** Provides an interactive and intuitive user interface to test email classification in real-time.
- **Model Persistence:** Saves the trained model and vectorizer to avoid retraining every time the application is run.
